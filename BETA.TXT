Easy Delphi Structures Library [EZDSL]
------------------------------

At long last I've managed to get an hour or so to myself and tidy up the code 
for the Delphi successor to my EZSTRUCS library. It's called EZDSL now, and 
has been written exclusively for Delphi.

The files in the accompanying ZIP file are as follows:

EZDSLBSE.PAS - Base unit, defines ancestor
EZDSLBTR.PAS - Binary tree unit
EZDSLCOL.PAS - collection unit
EZDSLCTS.PAS - constants unit
EZDSLCTS.RC  - string constants
EZDSLCTS.RES - compiled EZDSLCTS.RC
EZDSLDBL.PAS - doubly linked list unit
EZDSLDEF.INC - compiler defines include file
EZDSLLST.PAS - single linked list
EZDSLPQU.PAS - priority queue unit
EZDSLQUE.PAS - queue and deque unit
EZDSLSKP.PAS - skip list unit
EZDSLSTK.PAS - stack unit
EZDSLSUP.PAS - supplementary routines
EZRNDSTM.PAS - random number stream unit

DTSTBTRE.DPR - test program for binary trees
DTSTCOLL.DPR - test program for collections
DTSTLIST.DPR - test program for all lists
DTSTSTAK.DPR - test program for stacks and queues

There is no documentation. Obviously it might help if you have EZSTRUCS, but 
check out the test programs for some ideas. The docs are on my list of things 
to do, no promises as to when they'll be done.

Also on my list of things to do is support for streaming (especially for the 
collection class). 

My to do list is severely constrained at the moment with my work on the 
Orpheus Table control at TurboPower. Hopefully by the end of June I might 
have some time available but no promises.

For bug reports, support and suggestions, please e-mail me on CompuServe. My 
ID is 100116,1572. Please do not call me at TurboPower, nor use the PCVENB 
section 6 forum (TurboPower's forum). 

Cheers, Julian    (TeamB & TurboPower Software)
